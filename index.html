            <h1>Design, photos, food, travel, bagpipes, boxing, basketball, shoes, surfing, sunshine, Karrie & my boy River Fox.
            </h1>

            <p class="top">I started a business five years ago called <a href="http://theworkshop.co/">The Workshop</a> – a collective of
                designers, engineers and entrepreneurs helping companies create new brands and products for mobile and beyond.
                I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with brilliant minds, startups and established organisations along the
                way. During this time I also served as a creative advisor to several companies, including Yoyo Wallet – a
                mobile payments and loyalty platform, and more recently <a href="https://myarea.com/">Area</a> – a mobile
                proposition I recently co-founded looking to reimagine how you discover and buy your next home.</p>
            <p class="top">In 2013 I co-founded <a href="https://twitter.com/thegive_is">The Give</a> – a free community workshop series
                that brings together industry leaders to solve the greatest growth challenges facing a social enterprise.
                We’ve unlocked ideas for over 30 non-profit organisations including The Future Project, MBAs Across America
                & Mama Hope.</p>
            <p class="top">Prior to The Workshop I ran a small brand design studio in New York City called Candescent. In 2010 we merged
                with The Ito Partnership – a brand strategy firm focused on social impact organisations. A highlight was
                branding the Global Poverty Project alongside their yearly festival, Global Citizen.</p>

            <h1>When I’m not working, you can hear me playing the bagpipes!</h1>
            <p>I’ve been playing at a professional level since I was 16 and recognised on the world stage as a top soloist and
                composer. I’m also a member of the ScottishPower Pipe Band – one of the top pipe bands in the world. I’ve
                shared the concert stage with the London Philharmonic Orchestra & even my fellow Canadian Alanis Morissette.
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the bagpipes, I recently started <a href="http://www.unreel.fm/">Unreel.fm</a> – a monthly mixtape
                of innovative bagpipe music and commentary. Until now there was no direct hub for a progressive style of
                bagpipe music which the next generation is keen to listen to these days.</p>
            <p>I have a deep love for <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jbriscoe">photography</a> and my camera travels the world
                with me. A few years ago when I met my wife, we decided to pack our bags and tour all parts of Mexico for
                3-months and created a little travel journal to document and share our adventures with family and friends
                called <a href="http://10and3.com/">10and3.</a></p>
            <p>I geek out over well designed hotels and enjoy eating at some of the best restaurants in the world. I enjoy seeing
                others thrive and am currently mentoring the ‘Tribes’ of <a href="http://www.escapethecity.org/">Escape the City</a>.
                I have too many pairs of trainers, love to surf and before my laser eye surgery in 2015 owned 24 pairs of
                eyeglasses – because of this I’m currently on a <a href="https://thevisionmission.jasonbriscoe.com/">mission</a>                to give someone a fresh set of eyes. I’m inspired by architecture, music, conversations, Chef’s Table on
                Netflix, my wife <a href="http://www.karrieleeyoga.com/">Karrie</a> & my son <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riverfoxb/">River Fox</a>.</p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
