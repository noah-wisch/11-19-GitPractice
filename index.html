            <h1>Design, photos, food, travel, bagpipes, boxing, basketball, shoes, surfing, sunshine, Karrie & my boy River Fox.
            </h1>

            <p class="top">I started a business five years ago called The Workshop – a collective of designers, engineers and entrepreneurs
                helping companies create new brands and products for mobile and beyond. I’ve been fortunate to collaborate
                with brilliant minds, startups and established organisations along the way. During this time I also served
                as a creative advisor to several companies, including Yoyo Wallet – a mobile payments and loyalty platform,
                and more recently Area – a mobile proposition I recently co-founded looking to reimagine how you discover
                and buy your next home.</p>
            <p class="top">In 2013 I co-founded The Give – a free community workshop series that brings together industry leaders to solve
                the greatest growth challenges facing a social enterprise. We’ve unlocked ideas for over 30 non-profit organisations
                including The Future Project, MBAs Across America & Mama Hope.</p>
            <p class="top">Prior to The Workshop I ran a small brand design studio in New York City called Candescent. In 2010 we merged
                with The Ito Partnership – a brand strategy firm focused on social impact organisations. A highlight was
                branding the Global Poverty Project alongside their yearly festival, Global Citizen.</p>

            <h1>When I’m not working, you can hear me playing the bagpipes!</h1>
            <p>I’ve been playing at a professional level since I was 16 and recognised on the world stage as a top soloist and
                composer. I’m also a member of the ScottishPower Pipe Band – one of the top pipe bands in the world. I’ve
                shared the concert stage with the London Philharmonic Orchestra & even my fellow Canadian Alanis Morissette.
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the bagpipes, I recently started Unreel.fm – a monthly mixtape of innovative bagpipe music and commentary.
                Until now there was no direct hub for a progressive style of bagpipe music which the next generation is keen
                to listen to these days.</p>
            <p>I have a deep love for photography and my camera travels the world with me. A few years ago when I met my wife,
                we decided to pack our bags and tour all parts of Mexico for 3-months and created a little travel journal
                to document and share our adventures with family and friends called 10and3.</p>
            <p>I geek out over well designed hotels and enjoy eating at some of the best restaurants in the world. I enjoy seeing
                others thrive and am currently mentoring the ‘Tribes’ of Escape the City. I have too many pairs of trainers,
                love to surf and before my <a href="www.google.com">laser eye</a> surgery in 2015 owned 24 pairs of eyeglasses
                – because of this I’m currently on a mission to give someone a fresh set of eyes. I’m inspired by architecture,
                music, conversations, Chef’s Table on Netflix, my wife Karrie & my son River Fox.</p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
